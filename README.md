# Urvai
 Project Urvai is an AI system that predicts weather, simulates climate interventions, and optimizes geoengineering strategies using: ✅ LSTM (RNN) – Forecasts weather trends. ✅ Reinforcement Learning (PPO) – Learns optimal interventions (e.g., cloud seeding, heat deflection). ✅ XGBoost/Random Forest – Detects anomalies & trends.
